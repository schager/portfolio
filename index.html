                <h5>4.5☆</h5>
                <p>This was a very fun and magical read. This book doesn't take itself too seriously and has well-developed characters and world building.</p>

                <p>This book will take you on an emotional rollercoaster but I could not recommend it enough. It offers a very unique perspective on life and also tells a very sweet love story.</p>

                <p>Although this book isn't a mystery, the story unravels and reveals itself to the reader through many characters perspectives. It's a really fun read and I find myself coming back to it often.</p>

                <h4>Tahereh Mafi</h4>
                <h5>3.5☆</h5>
                <p>This is the first of a 6-book series. The book follows a girl with supernatural powers in a dystopian society. Although I prefer the later books in this series, this first book sets the tone well.</p>

                <h4>Taylor Jenkins Reid</h4>
                <h5>4.5☆</h5>
                <p>True to this author's reputation, this book is very complex with characters and storylines. I felt fully immersed in the beachy culture of Malibu in the 60s as well as the high-class culture of the 80s.</p>

                <p>This book is so sweet and highlights the experience of young love. All of the character relationships in the book feel so meaningful and they are what drive the book.</p>

                <p>This book follows the story of a human girl growing up in a mystical land of fairies and mythological creatures. It's a great introduction to fantasy for readers who want to try out the genre.</p>

                <p>This book is another great introduction to the fantasy genre. The dystopian world-building is easy to follow and the book keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.</p>
