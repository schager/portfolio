                    Hi! I'm Zoe Schager, a current student at the University of Oregon. I love reading, talkikng about books, and finding new authors.
                    This website is a great way to connect with me and start more conversations about reading and what makes a good book.

                <p>
                    As an art and technology student, I also have a passion for digital design. This website was designed to be functional, but like
                    most of what I do, I also see it as an art project. Besdies digital design I'm also very passionate about other forms of art such 
                    as dance, music, and theatre.
